Could have made a public API so that I can display this on my website with MonkeyType's color themes but there is no hosting server that suits me and CORS policy.






PS: Update coming soon.

PS 2: So a Thai Developer(?) Vtuber's video randomly popped up on my YouTube feed and it reminded me that I can now run Python straight in the website. It makes me wonder: Can I some how make this code work on a website and bypass CORS policy at the same timeðŸ¤”?

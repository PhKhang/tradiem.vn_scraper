But... Muh grades...

## The challenges
This is the first time I've used Python to scrape data. The data was locked behind a login page so I had to learn how the webpage sends and receives these kind of authenticated data and how to utilize the power of Python's vast library resources like requests, beautifulsoup, panda, rich,...

Could have made a public API so that I can display this on my website with MonkeyType's color themes but there is no hosting server that suits me and CORS policy.






PS: Update coming soon.

PS 2: So a Thai Developer(?) Vtuber's video randomly popped up on my YouTube feed and it reminded me that I can now run Python straight in the website. It makes me wonder: Can I some how make this code work on a website and bypass CORS policy at the same timeðŸ¤”?
